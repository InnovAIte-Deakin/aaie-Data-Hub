Frameworks like the Community of Inquiry model highlight the importance of social, cognitive, and teaching presence in virtual classrooms. Major challenges include digital divide, student isolation, and maintaining engagement. Conversely, online education offers opportunities for personalized learning and global access. Research (e.g., Hodges et al., 2020) emphasizes the need for intentional course design and continuous feedback. Effective strategies include active discussion forums, regular low-stakes quizzes, and synchronous sessions to foster community. By leveraging technology and thoughtful practices, instructors can create high-quality, engaging virtual learning experiences.",

Problems like unstable internet or students not turning on cameras make classes challenging. Some universities use breakout rooms and online polls so that everyone can contribute and stay active.
