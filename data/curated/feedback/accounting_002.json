Standards such as APES 110 and the IFAC Code provide essential frameworks to guide ethical conduct in financial reporting. Major ethical failures like those seen in Enron and WorldCom severely damaged public trust and highlighted the consequences of ethical breaches. Ethical behavior enhances transparency and stakeholder trust while unethical conduct can lead to fraud, loss of credibility, and regulatory penalties. Maintaining strong ethical standards is critical to ensure compliance, build investor confidence, and uphold the integrity of financial statements.",

Ethical lapses, like the Enron scandal, are not just historical cases — they’re reminders of what happens when ethical codes like APES 110 are disregarded. Without ethical guidance, even accurate data loses its meaning. Stakeholders depend on transparency, and that depends on ethics being more than just a checklist.",

The APES 110 code provides guidance for accountants to act with integrity and objectivity. When ethics are not followed, as seen in accounting scandals, the result is a loss of trust and credibility. Ethics also help reduce fraud and promote regulatory compliance. Therefore, adhering to ethical principles benefits both organizations and the public.",
