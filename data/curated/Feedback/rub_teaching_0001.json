These approaches encourage active participation and collaboration, rooted in constructivist theory. Studies like Freeman et al. (2014) provide strong empirical support showing enhanced performance and retention. Effective implementation requires addressing challenges such as large class sizes and varied student readiness, where integrating technology like polling apps and online discussion forums can be invaluable.",

Research demonstrates that when students actively participate, they retain more information and perform better on assessments.
