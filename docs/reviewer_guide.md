## When Do I Review a PR?

When someone creates a PR to add or edit files in the project, they will request **at least two peer reviewers** and one senior lead reviewer.

Your job is to check:
- Is the submission complete and in the right format?
- Does the JSON follow the schema?
- Are file names, folder locations, and content correct?
- Does the content make sense?

### 3. Review the Files

1. Click the **“Files changed”** tab
2. Read through the files
3. Look for:
   - Missing fields
   - Typos or unclear content
   - Incorrect folder structure
   - Schema issues (use the validation script if needed)

You can leave **line-by-line comments** by clicking the "+" next to a line.

### 4. Approve or Request Changes

At the top-right (or bottom) of the PR page, click the **“Review changes”** button.

You’ll see 3 options:
- **Approve** – Everything looks good
- **Comment** – You want to give feedback, but not block it
- **Request changes** – Something must be fixed before it can be accepted

Add a short message (e.g., “Schema looks good, approved”) and click **Submit review**.
