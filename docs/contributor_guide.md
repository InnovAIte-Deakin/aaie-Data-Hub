## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Make Sure You're Set Up
Follow the [`setup_instructions.md`](../setup_instructions.md) to fork, clone, and set up your environment.

### 2. Create a New Branch

Always branch off the latest `development` branch from upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b your-branch-name upstream/development
```

Use a short and clear name, like `fix-json-validation` or `add-rubric-psychology`.

### 3. Add Your Contribution

- For documentation: add your `.md` file in the appropriate `docs/` folder
- For dataset JSON: place your file in `data/curated/` if it's complete, or `data/raw/` if it's unprocessed
- For scripts: place Python tools in `scripts/` (under a relevant subfolder)
- For notebooks: save under `notebooks/` and clearly name the purpose

### 4. Validate Your Work

If you're submitting a JSON file make sure:
- Schema is followed
- File is named correctly
- No missing or extra fields

git commit -m "Short message describing your change"
git push origin your-branch-name
```
