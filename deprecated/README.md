# Deprecated Folder â€“ Archive of Early Work

This folder contains **archived work** created **before the AAIE GitHub repository was ready** and the current workflow was implemented.

> **WARNING: This folder is deprecated.**  
> The files and structure here **do not reflect the latest dataset schema, workflow, or project standards**.

---

## Purpose

This folder exists for **historical reference only**, to document early work completed during the planning and pre-GitHub phases of the AAIE Data Curation project. It may include:

- Early versions of prompts, rubrics, or JSON structures
- Outdated scripts or data examples
- Draft documentation and workflows that were not finalized

---

## Do Not Use in Active Development

All active work must follow the current structure and guidelines found in the main project folders (e.g., `data/curated`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, etc.).

> Please refer to the `development` branch in the [upstream repository](https://github.com/InnovAIte-Deakin/aaie-Data-Hub/tree/development) for the latest files and instructions.
